# Assorted-fg-CustomScenery

The intention with this pack is to provide a fusion of various custom sceneries that many people would otherwise have a difficult time finding, since most of these were scattered all over the web and not provided in bulk by one author – as is the case with certain developers who have done scenery for FG such as [D-ECHO](https://github.com/D-ECHO?tab=repositories) and [legoboyvdlp](https://github.com/legoboyvdlp?tab=repositories), among several others.

Inside, you will find everything from airport layouts and objects (some even with custom models), to even [osm2city](https://osm2city.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) structures and airport/navigation data!

-----

I have already installed the individual custom scenery packs in the proper way – all you'll need to do is download and add the folder into your FG launcher/arguments just as you would with any other custom scenery.

I do not claim any of this great work as my own. It would be wrong to not give credit to the original authors and provide reference to where I found everything included in this pack, so here goes:
